One of our team-mate was on etherscan exploring some transactions and saw an advertisement on https://stake.com/ which was giving a 200% bonus on the first deposit, when our team-mate deposited the 120 USDT into this platform they gave him 360 USDT as the total balance and when our teammate started playing game he was shocked to see that he was only able to play with $1 per game of Plinko Casino Game on Stake.com and was unable to increase the betting amount beyond $1 because he was using the bonus scheme of 200% and when he tried to explore and play other games on the platform he got to know that this platform has cheated him under the name of wager limits.

When he tried to withdraw money they showed him this rule list of wager limits which said that if he wanted to withdraw the deposited amount then he had to play $12,300 worth of games this was a big shock for him when he was explained a maths logic by their live support. Thereby, In the hope of getting the deposited money back, he played the game Plinko the entire night and lost all his money.

He was very annoyed by this and that's how APT-Casino was born, which is a combination of Gamefi and Defi all in one platform where new web2 and web3 gamers/ gamblers can play games, and perform gambling but have a safe, secure, transparent platform that does not scam any of their users. Also, we wanted to address common issues in traditional gaming and gambling platforms.

APT-Casino is a next-generation decentralized gaming platform that integrates **GameFi**, **GambleFi**, and **DeFi**, fully powered by **Euclid Protocol** and deployed on the **Nibiru Chain**. The platform delivers a provably fair, scalable, and accessible gaming experience by leveraging cross-chain liquidity and decentralized asset management.
